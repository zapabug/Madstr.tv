Setting the App Icon (for Android/iOS)**

This involves configuring the native projects managed by Capacitor. The recommended way uses the Capacitor Assets tool:

*   **Install the tool:**
    ```bash
    npm install -D @capacitor/assets
    # or
    yarn add -D @capacitor/assets
    # or
    pnpm add -D @capacitor/assets
    ```
*   **Create Source Files:**
    *   Create an `assets` folder in your project's root directory (if it doesn't exist).
    *   Place your main app icon file inside it, named exactly `icon.png`. It should be high resolution (at least 1024x1024 pixels) and ideally square with transparency if needed.
    *   (Optional) You can also create a `splash.png` (2732x2732 pixels) in the `assets` folder for the splash screen.
*   **Generate Icons:** Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    npx @capacitor/assets generate --iconBackgroundColor '#ffffff' --splashBackgroundColor '#ffffff'
    ```
    (Adjust the background colors as needed if your icons don't fill the whole square).
*   **Sync:** After generating, run `npx cap sync android` again to make sure the native projects pick up the changes.

This command will automatically generate all the necessary icon sizes for Android (placing them in `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*` directories) and iOS (if you had an iOS platform).

Let me know which logo you want to implement, and if you have your logo file ready!
