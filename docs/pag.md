# Summary of Changes Before Reverting (VideoList Functionality)

The main difference between the current state and the state immediately preceding the revert is the **presence and implementation of the `src/components/VideoList.tsx` component**.

This component contained the following key features and changes:

1.  **Core Video Note Handling:**
    *   Logic to fetch video notes (events with video URLs) from Nostr based on a list of author pubkeys.
    *   Implemented IndexedDB caching (`VIDEO_NOTE_DB_NAME`) for fetched video notes to improve load times and persistence.
    *   Functionality (`processEventsIntoVideoNotes`) to parse Nostr events, extract video URLs, and format them into a `VideoNote` interface.

2.  **Profile Fetching and Caching:**
    *   `useEffect` hook to identify unique author pubkeys from the displayed video notes.
    *   A function (`fetchVideoAuthorProfile`) to fetch Nostr profile metadata (kind 0) for these authors using NDK.
    *   Integrated profile caching (using utility functions likely from `src/utils/profileCache.ts`) to store and retrieve author profile details (name, picture, etc.).
    *   **Note:** We were actively debugging a TypeScript type inference issue within this `useEffect` hook where `pubkey` was being incorrectly inferred as `string | number` when calling `fetchVideoAuthorProfile`, despite attempts at type narrowing using `.filter()` with a type predicate.

3.  **User Interface (UI) Elements:**
    *   **Video/Podcast Toggle:** Added `useState` for `viewMode` and implemented toggle buttons (initially replacing the static "Video List" header) to switch between hypothetical "Video" and "Podcast" views.
    *   **Video Item Display:** Rendered a list of video items, each showing:
        *   A generic video icon.
        *   The author's profile picture (fetched or placeholder).
        *   The author's display name (fetched or truncated pubkey).
        *   Loading indicators for profiles being fetched.
    *   **Pagination Controls:**
        *   Added `useState` for `currentPage`.
        *   Implemented basic pagination logic (`ITEMS_PER_PAGE`, slicing the `videoNotes` array).
        *   Added pagination buttons below the list. Initially, these were simple text buttons ("Older", "Newer"), with the plan being to replace them with specific SVG buttons you intended to provide.
    *   **Styling:** Used Tailwind CSS classes for layout and appearance, consistent with the rest of the application.

4.  **State Management:**
    *   Used `useState` extensively for managing component state (video notes, profiles, loading status, current item index, view mode, current page).
    *   Used `useRef` for managing mutable references like the map of notes by ID and the processing pubkeys set.
    *   Used `useCallback` for memoizing functions like `fetchVideoAuthorProfile`.
    *   Used `useMemo` within the profile-fetching `useEffect` to memoize the calculation of unique pubkeys.

5.  **Integration (Assumed):**
    *   The `VideoList.tsx` component was likely intended to be imported and used within a parent component (e.g., `App.tsx` or `MediaFeed.tsx`) to display the video feed.

In essence, the reverted state removed the entire implementation dedicated to fetching, caching, displaying, and navigating video-related Nostr notes.
