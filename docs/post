Hey #nostriches, I Need Your Help to Make Mad⚡tr.tv Even Better!

What’s up, everyone? I’m the guy behind Mad⚡tr.tv, a little project I started because I wanted a chill way to watch Nostr creators’ images, videos, and podcasts on my TV. I had no coding experience when I began—just a big idea and a lot of trial and error. Honestly, I was stoked when I got it working for my own setup, and now I’m wondering if it could be something the broader Nostr community might vibe with too.

Here’s where I need your input: there’s this “Message Board” panel that shows up when the app isn’t in fullscreen mode. I want it to be something you’d actually find useful or fun to glance at, but I’m stuck on what would work best. The tricky part is keeping it interactive and spam-free—nobody wants to see random noise, right?

So, I’d love to hear from you: when the Message Board is visible (not fullscreen), what would make it something you’d actually care about seeing? Here are some ideas I’ve been tossing around:

    Talk About What’s On: Show replies specifically about the image or video playing right now, but only from people you follow—so it’s relevant and not a mess.
    Creator’s Corner: Pull messages from the content creator’s main chat channel (if we can find it), again only showing stuff from your follows to keep it focused on the creator.
    Your Follows’ Latest: Just a simple feed of recent posts from everyone you follow, like a mini-Nostr feed, even if it’s not tied to the media playing.
    Your Hangout Spot: Let you pick your favorite Nostr chat thread (you’d set it in your profile), and show replies from that thread—filtered to just your follows.
    Keep it Simple: Skip the fancy chat stuff. Maybe just a basic setup or even placeholder text since the panel disappears in fullscreen anyway.

What do you think? Which option would make the Message Board something you’d actually enjoy seeing? Or if you’ve got a totally different idea, I’m all ears! Drop your thoughts below—I’m super excited to hear what you think. Let’s make this app something we all love! ⚡
