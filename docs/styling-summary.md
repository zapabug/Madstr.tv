# Styling & UI/UX Refinements Summary (TV App)

This document summarizes the key styling and user experience improvements implemented for the TV application, focusing on large-screen display optimization and remote control navigation.

## 1. Overall Layout & Aesthetics

*   **Root Container (`App.tsx`):**
    *   Reduced top padding (`pt-4`) for better screen utilization.
    *   Softened border (`border-2 border-purple-900`) for a less obtrusive look.
    *   Introduced a subtle background (`bg-gradient-radial from-gray-900 via-black to-black`) for visual depth.
*   **Color Palette:** Primarily dark theme (`bg-black`, `bg-gray-900/80`, `bg-gray-800/80`) with purple accents (`border-purple-900`, button text/highlights, QR code text) for branding consistency (Nostr-inspired).
*   **Title:** Cleaned up (`top-2 right-4 text-base`), non-interactive (`pointer-events-none`).

## 2. Split Panel (`MessageBoard` & `MediaPanel`)

*   **Height:** Reduced height (`h-1/4`) to give more prominence to the main media view.
*   **Backgrounds:** Switched to semi-transparent backgrounds (`bg-gray-900/80`, `bg-gray-800/80`) with a `backdrop-blur-sm` effect for a modern, layered feel.
*   **Spacing:** Increased margins between the top/bottom panels (`mt-2`) and between the left/right bottom panels (`ml-2`).
*   **Padding:** Added internal padding (`p-2`) to these panels for content breathing room.

## 3. Buttons & Interactivity

*   **General Styling:** Buttons (Prev/Next, Toggles, future `MediaPanel` controls) use consistent styling:
    *   Subtle background (`bg-black/30` or `bg-black/50` for absolute, theme colors like `bg-blue-700` for panel buttons).
    *   Clear hover states (`hover:bg-...`).
    *   Distinct focus states using rings (`focus:ring-2 focus:ring-yellow-400` or `focus:ring-purple-400`) and offsets (`focus:ring-offset-black`) for high visibility during D-pad navigation.
    *   Smooth transitions (`transition-all duration-150`) on hover/focus changes.
*   **Prev/Next Buttons:**
    *   Positioned vertically centered, closer to the media area.
    *   Use restored, potentially wider SVG icons (`M15 5 L 13 12 L 15 19`, `M9 5 L 11 12 L 9 19`).
    *   Hide during fullscreen mode with a fade animation.
*   **Toggle Buttons ("Videos"/"Images"):**
    *   Original button remains in `MediaPanel`'s controls.
    *   Duplicated instance added to the top media area (bottom-right, left of author QR).
    *   Duplicated button hides during fullscreen mode with a fade animation.
*   **Video Overlay Play Button (`VideoPlayer.tsx`):**
    *   Icon color changed to purple (`text-purple-400`).
    *   Visibility logic updated: Only shown if autoplay failed or video is playing muted.
*   **Hidden Settings Button (`RelayStatus.tsx`):**
    *   Integrated *inside* the `RelayStatus` component.
    *   Uses `opacity-0 focus:opacity-100` (and `group-focus-within`) to appear only when focused, remaining visually hidden otherwise.

## 4. QR Codes & Status Indicators

*   **Main QR Code (Bottom-Left):**
    *   Slightly increased size (`w-20 h-20`+).
    *   Increased padding (`p-1.5`) on white background for better scan margins.
    *   Positioning preserved.
*   **Author QR Code (Bottom-Right in Media Area):**
    *   Rendered inside `ImageFeed`/`VideoPlayer`.
    *   Positioned absolutely (`bottom-2 right-2`) with standard sizing.
*   **Relay Status Indicator:**
    *   Minimal dot (`w-2 h-2`) with color indicating status (`bg-green-500` / `bg-yellow-500`).
    *   Text removed for cleaner look.
    *   Positioning preserved, now contains the hidden settings button.

## 5. Animations & Transitions (`framer-motion`)

*   **Media View Switch:** Smooth cross-fade (`opacity`, `duration: 0.5`) between `ImageFeed` and `VideoPlayer` using `AnimatePresence` and `motion.div`.
*   **Fullscreen Mode:**
    *   Bottom panel slides up/down and fades (`y`, `opacity`, `duration: 0.5`) using `motion.div`.
    *   Top toggle button and Prev/Next buttons fade in/out (`opacity`, `duration: 0.3`) using `motion.button`/`motion.div`.

## 6. TV Focus & Navigation

*   Relies heavily on standard browser D-pad navigation between focusable elements (`button`, `input[type=range]`, list items with `tabIndex={0}`).
*   Focus states are enhanced with Tailwind's `focus:` variants (rings, background changes) for clear visual feedback.
*   Specific focus edge cases (like seek bar escape) are handled by existing JavaScript logic (from `focus-trap-issue.md`, assumed implemented in `MediaPanel` or similar).
*   New interactive elements (duplicated toggle, hidden settings button) are made focusable (`tabIndex={0}`).
